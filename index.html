  Hello world!!!

  START STUFF

  I am all excited starting a new
  FEATURE!!!

  // THE IMPORTANT STUFF FOR TODAY
  git status (dont nest repos!)
  git init (start a repo, hidden .git folder)
  git add . & git commit (create commits)
  git log (chain of commits)
  git checkout hash (time travel on same chain/branch)
  git checkout -b branchname (create new and check it out)
  git checkout branchname (move to existing branch tip)

  // CHERRY ON TOP
  git stash & git stash pop

  // useful!

  the killer feature

  // teacher codes things
  // teacher makes commits to his lecture branch & PUSHES
  // teacher codes really hard stuff
  // teacher makes commits to his lecture branch & PUSHES

  feature horrible
  yadda yadda
